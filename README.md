- 👋 Hi, I’m Stephen (@burkalopolis)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to build my own web application and business model to scale a product addressing community health and wellness. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on entrepreneurship and full stack software development from React.js web application to mobile application scale.
